* **Error Response:**

  * **Code:** 403 FORBIDDEN

```

* **Notes:**

    * The **charging modes** here are named differently than in the ChargeApp.
    Remote is called App Control, Home Manager is Energy Manager and Time is Time control.
    * **Tariffs**: T1 - Main tariff, T2 - Off-peak tariff, T3 - Solar energy tariff
    * The objects prefixed with **T** have the same values as values without the prefix. 
    I'm not sure what purpose they serve.
