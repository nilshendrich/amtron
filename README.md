### General Information

* The **DevKey required for each request** can be found in the documents you received with your Wallbox.
In the document it is called **APP-Pin**.
* Every request has to have the header param `Accept: application/json`.
* Every path shown below has a base url of `http://amtron-ip:25000/MHCP/1.0`
* Useful information can be found at the bottom of every page under **Notes**.
* Amtron Wallboxes dont like to be stressed with requests. Dont overdo it.
